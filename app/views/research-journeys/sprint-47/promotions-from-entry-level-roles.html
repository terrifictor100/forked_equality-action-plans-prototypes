        <p>
          Promotion refers to a permanent change when an employee advances or
          rises to a higher office or rank on an ongoing basis or fixed-term
          contract and does not return to the previous role.
        </p>
        <p>
          This includes when employees are promoted from one managerial role to
          another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Temporary changes, employees relocating to overseas offices, and those
          that transfer to a position of equal rank (despite an increase in
          duties) are not considered promotions.
        </p>
