        Action plans: Suggested actions tool
      </h1>

      <p>
        From 2027 onwards, employers with over 250 employees must submit an
        action plan alongside their gender pay gap report. This action plan must
        show how they intend to address their gender pay gap, and to support
        employees going through the menopause.
      </p>
      <p>
        The actions on your plan must be selected from our list of actions, all
        of which are backed by evidence demonstrating their effectiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use this suggested actions tool to tell us about your
        organisation and workforce and get tailored recommendations for actions
        to put on your action plan.
      </p>
