  Menopause symptoms can have a significant impact on women at work.

  Up to a third of women will experience severe menopausal symptoms that can
  impact on their quality of life. Women often report greater difficulty in
  managing symptoms while at work. They can feel embarrassed and unable to speak
  up, fearing they may be stigmatised for being menopausal.
