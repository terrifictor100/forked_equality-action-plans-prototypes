  In organisations where transparency is low, employees often donâ€™t know what is
  needed to get a promotion, a pay rise or a high-profile assignment, or how
  these decisions are made. According to research, this lack of transparency is
  particularly damaging to women, who then may be less likely to:

  <li>
    put themselves forward if selection criteria are ambiguous
  </li>
  <li>
    have access to senior leaders and sponsors who can help them in the absence
    of clear policies and processes
  </li>
</ul>

  Women are also more concerned with the potential of backlash if they question
  a decision around pay or progression. This is backed up by research which
  shows women are more likely to experience this backlash than men.

  Transparency creates accountability. Without it, bias is more likely to affect
  decision-making in ways that potentially disadvantage women or other
  under-represented groups.
