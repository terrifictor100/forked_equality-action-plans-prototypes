  Organisations that take transparency seriously can benefit from giving all
  their employees the best chance and information they need to succeed.
</p>
<p>
  Transparency can also improve the acceptance of decisions by all employees, of
  all genders, because they understand the decision-making process.

  Being transparent towards staff internally is highly valuable. However, it may
  also be beneficial to increase how transparent you are towards those outside
  the organisation as it can help attract more candidates looking for clarity
  over ambiguity.
