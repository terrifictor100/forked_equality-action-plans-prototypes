  Speak to staff. Find out if your employees are aware of these processes and if
  they understand them. 
</p>
<p>
  You can do this by discussing it directly with them, or by an anonymous staff
  survey. This will help to ensure people feel comfortable being honest and
  giving critical feedback about what they do and do not understand.

  Use this employee feedback to prioritise which processes to target.
