  60% of your organisation are women, but only 24% of the promotions in the last
  year went to women. This suggests there may be an unintentional bias towards
  men in the promotions process.

<p>
  Women tend to apply for promotion less frequently than men.
  (<a href="#">See the evidence</a>.)
  This means that they miss out on promotions that men are getting simply because
  they applied and the women didn't. By including everyone in the promotions
  process by default, you remove this difference and give everyone an equal
  chance to be assessed for promotion.
