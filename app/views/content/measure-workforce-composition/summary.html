  You already collect a basic breakdown of your workforce as part of your legal
  responsibilities. However, you can enhance this information by adding rates
  of full-time, part-time and casual work, gender split by industry and the
  proportion of each gender in leadership as well as the rates of resignations,
  promotions and appointments by gender.
