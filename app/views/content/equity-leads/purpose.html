  Diversity leads establish diversity initiatives and create fair processes
  within an organisation. These processes create a framework that all employees
  can use to improve equality.

  Diversity task forces develop, champion and implement the initiatives. They
  represent a broad range of people and provide perspectives on how processes
  and structures within an organisation can be more inclusive.
