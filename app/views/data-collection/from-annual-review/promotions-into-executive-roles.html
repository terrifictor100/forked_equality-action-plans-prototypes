  <p>
    Promotion refers to a permanent change when an employee advances or rises to
    a higher office or rank on an ongoing basis or fixed-term contract and does
    not return to the previous role.
  </p>
  <p>
    This includes when employees are promoted from one managerial role to another.
  </p>
  <p>
    Temporary changes, employees relocating to overseas offices, and those that
    transfer to a position of equal rank (despite an increase in duties) are not
    considered promotions.
