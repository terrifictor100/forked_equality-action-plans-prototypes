        This page would likely only be shown the first time an org needs to do an
        annual review. Otherwise it would be skipped.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every year after your action plan is created, you will be asked to review it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every three years, this will be a thorough evaluation of all actions and a
        reselection of new actions for your action plan. In the intervening years,
        only a brief summary of progress and measurement is required.
      </p>
      <p>
        As this is your first year of review, we will only ask you two brief summary
        questions. You can also update your plan at this stage but it is not required.
      </p>
