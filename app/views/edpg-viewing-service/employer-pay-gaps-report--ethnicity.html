{% set medianVsMeanExplanation %}
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The median ethnicity pay gap figure</h3>
  <p>
    This is the difference between the hourly pay of the median person in the
    largest ethnic group (in this case White British) and the hourly pay of the
    median person in other ethnic groups. The median for each group is the
    person in the middle of a list of hourly pay, ordered from highest to lowest paid.
  </p>
  <p>
    A median involves listing all of the numbers in numerical order. If there is
    an odd number of results, the median is the middle number. If there is an
    even number of results, the median will be the mean of the 2 central numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Medians are useful to indicate what the ‘typical’ situation is. They are not
    distorted by very high or low hourly pay, or bonuses. However, this means
    that not all ethnicity pay gap issues will be picked up. They could also fail
    to pick up as effectively where the ethnicity pay gap issues are most
    pronounced in the lowest paid or highest paid employees.
  </p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The mean (average) ethnicity pay gap figure</h3>
  <p>
    The mean ethnicity pay gap figure uses hourly pay of all employees to calculate
    the difference between the mean hourly pay of men, and the mean hourly pay
    of women.
  </p>
  <p>
    A mean involves adding up all of the numbers and dividing the result by how
    many numbers were in the list.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mean averages are useful because they place the same value on every number
    they use, giving a good overall indication of the ethnicity pay gap. Very high
    or low hourly pay can ‘dominate’ and distort the figure.
  </p>
{% endset %}

{% set payQuartersExplanation %}
  <p>
    Pay quarters show the percentage of employees in different groups in 4
    equally-sized bands based on their hourly pay.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pay quarters give an indication of representation at different
    levels of the organisation.
