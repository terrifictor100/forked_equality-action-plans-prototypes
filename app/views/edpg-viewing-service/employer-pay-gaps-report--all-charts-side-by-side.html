{% set medianVsMeanExplanation %}
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The median pay gap figure</h3>
  <p>
    This is the difference between the hourly pay of the median people in two
    different groups. The median for each is the person in that group who is in
    the middle of a list of hourly pay, ordered from highest to lowest paid.
  </p>
  <p>
    A median involves listing all of the numbers in numerical order. If there is
    an odd number of results, the median is the middle number. If there is an
    even number of results, the median will be the mean of the 2 central numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Medians are useful to indicate what the ‘typical’ situation is. They are not
    distorted by very high or low hourly pay, or bonuses. However, this means
    that not all pay gap issues will be picked up. They could also fail to pick
    up as effectively where the pay gap issues are most pronounced in the lowest
    paid or highest paid employees.
  </p>
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The mean (average) pay gap figure</h3>
  <p>
    The mean pay gap figure uses hourly pay of all employees to calculate the
    difference between the mean hourly pay of one group and the other.
  </p>
  <p>
    A mean involves adding up all of the numbers and dividing the result by how
    many numbers were in the list.
  </p>
  <p>
    Mean averages are useful because they place the same value on every number
    they use, giving a good overall indication of the pay gap. Very high or low
    hourly pay can ‘dominate’ and distort the figure.
  </p>

{% set payQuartersExplanation %}
  <p>
    Pay quarters show the percentage of employees in different groups in 4
    equally-sized bands based on their hourly pay.

    levels of the organisation.
